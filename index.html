            <li>Decide on other personal characteristics (personality, eye color, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can choose to do these in any order you like, but you probably want to roll your attributes first.
          </p>
          <p>
            Players may make as many characters as they like. The referee may limit the number of player-characters playable at once.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each character starts play with 200gp, which they can use to purchase their starting equipment
          </p>
          <p>
            If a character dies, the items they brought to play from character creation is assumed to be destroyed.

          <h2 id="attributes">Attributes</h2>
          <p>
            Attributes are rated from 0—10.
            To determine your starting attribute, roll 2d6−2 for each one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Attributes are mostly meant to determine what your character is like
            and for adjudicating certain situations
            (roll dexterity to pick locks for example).

        <h1 id="leveling-up">Leveling Up</h1>
        <p>
          A character who has earned sufficient XP may level up by spending
          some amount of downtime and resources to train.
        </p>
        <p>
          A character can only level up during downtime periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gaining multiple levels is permitted.
        </p>
        <h2 id="how-to-level-up">How to Level Up</h2>
        <p>
          Leveling up is mostly self-explanatory: Update your values according
          to your class's table and make any choices offered to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hit points are rolled using the Sticky-Up method.
        </p>
        <h3 id="sticky-up-hp-rolling">Sticky-Up HP Rolling</h3>
        <p>
          When you gain a new level, roll the dice indicated in your class's HP
          column. If you rolled equal to or lower than your previous HP total,
          your HP increases by 1. Otherwise, your HP becomes the number you
          rolled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, your HP is rerolled at each level, but can only go up (sticky-up).

        <h2 id="xp-rewards">XP Rewards</h2>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise noted, all XP is divided evenly amongst the party, rounded up to the nearest XP.

        <h1 id="adventuring">Adventuring</h1>
        <h2 id="marching-order">Marching Order</h2>
        <p>
          When travelling through potentially dangerous territory, such as the wilderness or dungeon,
          the players must present a marching order for the DM. Unless otherwise stated or obviously
          implied by the situation, the characters will be in their marching order.
        </p>
        <h2 id="attribute-checks">Attribute Checks</h2>
        <p>
          If you need to make an attribute check, roll a d20 + your attribute score
          against a DC set by the referee.
        </p>
        <h2 id="double-jeopardy">Double Jeopardy</h2>
        <p>
          In almost all cases, the same action cannot be attempted twice.
          For example, if a character fails to pick a lock, the party cannot
          retry that lock. They will need to do something substantively
          different, usually escalating the situation.
        </p>
        <h2 id="hit-points">Hit Points</h2>
        <p>
          Characters and creatures have hit points (HP), representing how much damage they can take before they
          are in trouble. Whenever a character or  creature suffers damage, that many hit points is subtracted
          from their current HP total.
        </p>
        <h3 id="maximum-hit-points">Maximum Hit Points</h3>
        <p>
          Characters and creatures have a maximum number of hit points that they can have at any one time.
          This number is typically increased by gaining levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an effect such as healing would increase a creature's current hit point total above their
          maximum hit points, their current hit points is instead set to their maximum hit points.
        </p>
        <h3 id="temporary-hit-points">Temporary Hit Points</h3>
        <p>
          Hit points are normally permanent and are only lost through damage. In contrast, temporary hit points
          are just that - temporary. They only last for a specified duration, or until the end of the
          adventure session, whichever comes first.
        </p>
        <p>
          These temporary hit points are lost first when the creature suffers damage and are not counted
          when determining a creature's current hit points. Thus temporary hit points are a way to have
          more hit points than your maximum hit points.
        </p>
        <p>
          Temporary hit points do not stack. If you currently have temporary hit points and would gain more
          temporary hit points, you instead take the larger of the two.
        </p>
        <h3 id="natural-healing">Natural Healing</h3>
        <p>
          Characters heal (regain) their level in hit points each night.
          If they rest all day, they heal twice as much.
        </p>
        <h3 id="first-aid">First Aid</h3>
        <p>
          Characters can be healed by use of a healer's kit.
          A character must have at least 5 wisdom to treat another character with a healer's kit.
          Using a healer's kit takes 1 minute, heals 1d6+3 hit points and consumes a usage of the kit.
        </p>
        <h3 id="unnatural-healing">Unnatural Healing</h3>
        <p>
          Some spells, magic items or other wondrous effects can heal characters.
          Such healing is only limited by whatever rules are associated with that spell, magic item, etc.
        </p>
        <h2 id="dying">Dying</h2>
        <p>
          Characters die at −10 HP or when circumstances dictate they should
          die.
        </p>
        <p>
          If in combat, measure time in rounds as usual. If not in combat,
          then begin measuring time in rounds to determine if you are able to
          save the character in time.
        </p>
        <p>
          A character at negative HP must roll to stabilize at a 10% chance
          at the beginning of their turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Characters who are not stable loses 1 HP at the beginning of their
          turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          A character who is healed or granted temporary hit points stabilizes.
        </p>
        <p>
          A character can be stabilized by a DC 15 wisdom check as a full-round
          action. Only one character may make this check each round.
        </p>
        <h2 id="damage">Damage</h2>
        <p>
          Ouch!
        </p>
        <h3 id="damage-reduction">Damage Reduction</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes referred to as DR, Damage Reduction reduces the amount of damage
          received from physical attacks, such as from weapons. It does not reduce the
          damage from fire, lightning, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Damage Reduction is applied separately to each instance of damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have multiple sources of Damage Reduction, only the best one applies.
        </p>
        <h3 id="resistance">Resistance</h3>
        <p>
          Resistance to a type of damage means you take half damage from that kind of
          damage, rounded up.
        </p>
        <h2 id="encumbrance">Encumbrance</h2>
        <p>
          Slots are a measurement of how encumbering an item is. Each item will specify
          how many slots they are or will be determined by the referee.
        </p>
        <p>
          A character can carry 10 + strength slots of items without being encumbered.
        </p>
        <p>
          They receive a −1 penalty to attack and AC for each slot beyond that they
          are carrying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two day's worth of food is 1 slot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Weapons are 1 slot, except for two-handed weapons which are 2 slots.
        </p>
        <h2 id="jumping">Jumping</h2>
        <p>
          To determine how far you can jump horizontally, roll 2d10 + your strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine how far you can jump vertically, roll d4 + half your strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, the target number is typically set by what you are
          trying to jump across or to and you need to roll that number.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can jump a horizontal distance up to your speed and a vertical
          distance up to 1.5x your height, rounded up to the nearest 5' increment.
        </p>
        <p>
          For every size category smaller than medium, you get −4 to your
          jump checks. For every size category larger than medium, add +4
          to your jump checks.
        </p>
        <p>
          For every 5' slower than 30', you get −2 to jump. For every 5'
          faster than 30', you get +2 to jump.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jumping in combat is normally a part of your movement for the turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          If something allows to jump as a specific action, then the amount
          of distance you jump is extra movement granted by that action.
        </p>
        <p>
          In combat, you cannot jump farther than your remaining movement
          for the round.
        </p>
        <h2 id="falling">Falling</h2>
        <p>
          Characters suffer 1d6 damage for every 10' fallen.
        </p>
        <h2 id="survival">Survival</h2>
        <h3 id="food-and-water">Food and Water</h3>
        <p>
          After 3 days, a character must make a fortitude save
          (DC 10 + 1 for each day without food beyond the 3 days) each day
          or suffer 1d6 unhealable damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each day of food heals 1d6 of this damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          After 1 day without water, a character must make a fortitude save
          (DC 10 + 5 for each day without water) each day
          or suffer 3d6 unhealable damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each day of water heals 1d6 of this damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          If characters go on half-rations,
          they suffer −2 to all d20 rolls
          but eat half as many rations each day
          and stave off the starvation damage.
        </p>
        <h3 id="heat-and-humidity">Heat and Humidity</h3>
        <p>
          A character in excessive clothing or wearing armor
          suffers 1d6 unhealable heat exhaustion damage each hour
          in hot and humid climates.
        </p>
        <p>
          An hour in cool shade with water heals 1d6 of this damage.
        </p>
        <h3 id="cold-and-freezing">Cold and Freezing</h3>
        <p>
          A characer in inadequate clothing suffers 1d6 unhealable
          freezing damage each hour in cold or arctic climates.
        </p>
        <p>
          An hour in shelter with fire heals 1d6 of this damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          In even extremer cold, the rate of damage is increased.
        </p>
        <h3 id="suffocation">Suffocation</h3>
        <p>
          A character without air suffers 1d6 suffocation damage
          each minute without air, beginning at 2 minutes.
        </p>
        <h2 id="mapping">Mapping</h2>
        <p>
          The players may map the dungeon if they so desire.
          The map is both an in-game and out of game object.
          If it is lost in the game, the DM will take it away.
          If it is lost out of game, the characters no longer
          have access to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a player character wishes to map, they must use both
          hands and have paper and ink and quill.
        </p>
        <h2 id="light">Light</h2>
        <p>
          Torches shed bright light in a 20' radius and shadowy
          light in a 20' radius beyond that. Torches burn for 1 hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lanterns shed bright light in a 40' radius and shadowy
          light in a 40' radius beyond that. Lanterns burn at the rate
          of 1oz per hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          The numbers above assume they are held in the hand or a similar
          elevation.  If they are placed on the ground, they illuminate
          half as much. Dropping them unexpectedly risks them going
          out (50% chance).
        </p>
        <h2 id="saving-throw">Saving Throw</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes referred to as a save, a saving throw is a roll to avoid
          or mitigate some harm.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are 3 kinds of saving throws, Fortitude, Reflex and Will,
          which represent your ability to avoid harm due to your toughness,
          your reflexes or your willpower.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every character has a BSB (Base Save Bonus)
          which they will add to any saving throw they make.
          Additionally, some classes and effects
          grant bonuses or penalties to specific kinds of saving throws.
        </p>
        <p>
          A saving throw is made by rolling a d20 + bonuses against a DC.
        </p>
        <h2 id="magic-item-division">Magic Item Division</h2>
        <p>
          Magic items and other useful items that are not easily divisible should
          be given out according to the following method:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
              The magic items are sorted in order of most desirable to
              least desirable.</li>
          <li>    The most desirable item remaining is up for claim.</li>
          <li>    Any character who could reasonably use that item may make a claim.
              Each player can only make a single claim, no matter the number of
              characters they control.</li>
          <li>    Amongst those who made a claim for an item, each rolls a d20 and
              whoever rolls the highest number is the owner of the item.
              In the event of a tie, there should be a roll-off between the
              highest rollers.</li>
          <li>    Repeat this process until each item is claimed. It is courtesy to
              not make a claim for items once you have won one, unless no one
              else wants it.
              </li>

          <p>
            Due to your weak tie to Venrik, you occasionally are seized with divine
            inspiration. When not stressed due to battle or other extenuating
            circumstances, choose 5 of the maneuvers you know. Those maneuvers are
            prepared for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Management of maneuvers is simulated by use of playing cards. Each
            card represents one of the maneuvers you have prepared. At the beginning
            of your first turn of the encounter draw three (3) cards at random from
            the 5 maneuvers you've prepared. At the beginning of your following turns,
            draw an additional card from the maneuvers you haven't drawn yet. When you
            use a maneuver, place the card in your discard pile. If you have no more
            maneuvers you can draw, discard your current hand of cards and shuffle it
            into your discard pile. That pile then becomes the new pool you can draw
            from. Immediately draw two cards.
          </p>
          <p>
            At higher levels you will know more maneuvers than you can prepare. To
            change your prepared maneuvers, you can spend 10 minutes meditating and
            praying to Venrik.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you gain a level in this class, you can choose a maneuver you know
            and replace it with a different maneuver of the same level.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are 3 kinds of maneuvers: Strikes, Counters and Boosts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise specified, strikes are a standard action to use and
            involve you making a melee standard attack. Counters are always a reaction
            action. Unless otherwise specified, boosts are swift actions.

          <p>
            As a disiciple of the enlightened, you have gained the ability to bring
            order to the chaotic elements of your soul. By meditating for 1 minute,
            you can remove the chaos from your system.
          </p>
          <p>
            This state of balance lasts until it is disrupted. Roll a d6 at the beginning
            of each turn in a stressful situation like combat. If you roll a 4, 5, or 6,
            your balance is disrupted. By disrupting it, you achieve a temporary state of
            enlightenment, walking in the footsteps of those that came before you — Gentle
            Breeze and Kruglauk.
          </p>
          <p>
            While in this state of enlightenment, you gain the following benefits:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You partially ignore the tragedy of flesh — You have <a href="#resistance">resistance</a> to all kinds of damage.</li>
            <li>Your mind is shielded from the influence of others — You automatically succeed on any saving throws against fear, rage, or other mental effects such as mind control.</li>
            <li>Your blows strike swift and true — You can make an unarmed melee <a href="#standard-attack">standard attack</a> as a free action each round.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These benefits last until you are unconscious, the battle is over or 10 minutes pass,
            whichever comes soonest.
          </p>
          <h3 id="unarmed-and-unarmored">Unarmed and Unarmored</h3>
          <p>
            While wearing no armor, your base AC is higher than 10. The value is given in your
            class table. You are deftly able to dodge blows due to your ability to perceive
            reality in a different way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, while wearing no armor your speed is increased by 10.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are deadly with the fist. Your unarmed strikes deal extra damage and can
            be <a href="#dual-wield-attack">dual-wielded</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You do not receive a penalty when attempting an unarmed <a href="#disarm">disarm</a> attempt.
          </p>
          <p>
            You do not need to be unarmed to make unarmed attacks.
            For example, you can kick or headbutt, even if your hands are full.

                            is hard to wrap your mind around, but allows you to appear wherever you desire,
                            as there is no &quot;where&quot;. You can appear at any &quot;location&quot;
                            you can see instantaneously as a free action up to &quot;600 feet away&quot;.

                            after you perform it you form pearls of doubt. You can't do this again until you
                            complete your meditation where you remove chaos from your system.

            The Dragon Knights of Bahamut train vigorously and are rewarded
            with special powers. Outside of battle, choose to ready a number
            of maneuvers as given by your class table. You cannot ready the
            same maneuver more than once. When a battle starts, you have
            immediate access to the maneuvers you have readied. Once you have
            used one of the maneuvers you have readied, you cannot use it again
            until you are recentered.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can recenter by taking a refocus action. This action grants you
            a melee <a href="#standard-attack">standard attack</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            At higher levels you will know more maneuvers than you can prepare.
            To change your prepared maneuvers, you can spend 10 minutes meditating.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you gain a level in this class, you can choose a maneuver you
            know and replace it with a different maneuver of the same level.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are 3 kinds of maneuvers: Strikes, Counters and Boosts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise specified, strikes are a standard action to use
            and involve you making a melee <a href="#standard-attack">standard attack</a>. Counters are always
            a reaction action. Unless otherwise specified, boosts are swift
            actions.

          <p>
            As a mage of the Seven Circles, you have mastered two of the namesake circles of magic.
            Their descriptions are given below. The number of circles you know is given in your
            class table.
          </p>
          <p>
            Choose two circles of magic at level 1 and once whenever you level up.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can cast these spells whenever you want, given you have your magic orb.
            You require your magic orb to cast spells.
            Some of these spells require your concentration to maintain the magic.
            You must be conscious and focused upon the magic and can only focus
            on one spell that requires your concentration at a time.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a spell is a <a href="#grenade-like-attack">grenade-like attack</a>, they are considered attacking with
            a wand.

          <h3 id="magic-weapon">Magic Weapon</h3>
          <p>
            You are an intelligent magical weapon. Unlike other characters, you must pick
            an alignment - Good, Neutral or Evil, and Lawful, Chaotic or Neutral.
            You can speak Fairish, and roll for bonus languages.
            You have no biology and thus are immune to things like poison,
            bleeding, exhaustion, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            At various levels you get additional magic bonuses. For Minor, Major,
            and Supreme bonuses, roll on the appropriate table. Each time you level
            up, you can reroll one magical bonus (you can ignore bonuses you have
            previously rerolled).
          </p>
          <p>
            For Alignment bonuses, pick one ability that matches any part of your alignment.
            If your alignment is altered, repick your alignment bonuses to match.
          </p>
          <p>
            As long as you are being wielded, you can take a standard action to attack.
            You do not threaten and cannot take attacks of opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can be sundered, however you have +4 on the defense roll as long
            as you are wielded. Additionally, you are more resistant to being sundered
            via your HP increment and Max Notches.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if you are completely alone, every successful sunder increases your notches
            by a minimum of 1, regardless of your hp increment.
          </p>
          <p>
            You heal 1 notch per night, 2 notches if you rest all day. Also, someone proficient
            in smithing can spend 1 hour and 100 gp per notch worth of supplies to heal notches.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you lose all your notches, you are broken and become dormant.

          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, at level 2 you become a +1 weapon, and at level 6 you become
            a +2 weapon, and at level 10 you become +3.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a double weapon, you off hand side has fewer enchantments.
            It has 1 lower +1,  and it has no minor or alignment enchantments
          </p>

          <p>
            You can willingly bond with another character via a 10 minute ritual.
            That character becomes your "user".
            This is necessary for certain abilities.
            You have telepathy with your user.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can only be bonded with one user at a time
          </p>
          <h3 id="transient-form">Transient Form</h3>
          <p>
            At level one, choose the form of any weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are brought to a spellforge a character proficient in smithing
            can forge you into a different weapon.
            You get to repick your sword arts when you do this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, you can transform into an accessory type item of your choice
            (ring, necklace, clasp, etc) as a swift action, and can transform back as a
            swift action. Choose what form this accessory is at 1st level.
          </p>
          <p>
            While in accessory form, you cannot make attacks.
            However, your non-attack related magical bonuses are active, and you can
            use sword arts if they have an (R) in their description.
          </p>
          <h3 id="enchantment">Enchantment</h3>
          <p>
            At certain levels indicated in your class table, you gain a special enchantment from the appropriate table.
            If you roll an ability you already have, roll again.

            You can absorb a magical item (1 hour ritual).
            This destroys the item, but you gain all of its abilities.
            You can only be attuned to one magical items abilities at a time.
            You can only swap between items in between adventures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certain abilities can't be absorbed, and some abilities won't stack with your normal class features.
            For example, eating a +1 sword doesn't make 1+1=+2 sword.
            However if you eat a +2 sword while you are +1, you can have +2 while attuned to that sword.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can't consume an intelligent weapon unless its + is smaller than yours.
            Also this is a dick move unless it is like an evil sword.

          <h3 id="artifact">Artifact</h3>

            The Master of the Five Humors understand the needed balance of the
            five essential humors: Blood, Black Bile, Yellow Bile, Phlegm and
            Occult Bile. When these humors are out of balance, illness and other
            tragedy ensue. However, he also knows how to manipulate these humors
            for temporary positive effects. It is dangerous to manipulate a person's
            humors too frequently. They can do so to a single creature once per
            minute and each concoction lasts for 1 minute.
          </p>
          <p>
            The master can create his concoctions by spending an hour in safety
            with his vials and a willing donor of humors (including himself).
            Each concoction takes a slot. He can create 12 from each donor per week.
          </p>
          <p>
            Injecting a concoction into a creature is a standard action. If the
            creature is unwilling, they are allowed a DC 15 reflex save to avoid.
            Only the master can inject these concoctions, everyone else is too dumb.
            Injection is a melee move or can be delivered via blowgun.

            Your referee may expand or restrict this list due to the setting or
            campaign premise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your animal knows the following tricks (assuming it is physically
            capable of them):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Attack</li>
            <li>Come</li>
            <li>Defend</li>
            <li>Down</li>
            <li>Fetch</li>
            <li>Guard</li>
            <li>Heel</li>
            <li>Perform</li>
            <li>Seek</li>
            <li>Stay</li>
            <li>Track</li>
            <li>Work</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Your animal performs these tricks by verbal or nonverbal communication.
            If you wish them to perform these tricks by a different word (such as
            using the elvish word for attack), note this, but each trick must have
            a single corresponding verbal
          </p>
          <p>
            Your animal is a selfless and loyal companion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to your bond and excellent training, your companion receives
            the following bonuses:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A bonus to attack equal to your level</li>
            <li>A bonus to AC equal to your level</li>
            <li>A bonus to saving throws equal to your level</li>
            <li>A bonus number of hit dice equal to your level</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Your animal companion uses a stat block that is not typical of other
            creatures of its kind. They already include the first level bonuses.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your companion perishes, you must raise a new one in order to replace
            them. Training a new companion takes at least 3 months.

          <h3 id="animal-forms">Animal Forms</h3>
          <p>
            Shapechangers have the unique ability to transform into
            an animal that they have established a spirit bond with.
            The number of bonds they can establish is limited by
            their level, as given in the class table above.
          </p>
          <p>
            To establish a spirit bond with an animal, the shapechanger
            must seek out and befriend the animal and either make a
            deal with it or earn its trust. The shapechanger and the
            animal then link their spirits together and the shapechanger
            is then able to turn into that specific animal.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the shapechanger dies, all the animals it has bonded
            become heartbroken.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shapechanger may change shape whenever they want and
            however many times they want. Changing shape is an
            instinctual action. In combat, it is a move action.
            The shapechanger can switch between animal forms or back
            to their normal form.  The shapechanger remains in the
            animal form until they consciously change shape again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Items worn or carried by the shapechanger do not change
            shape with them. For this reason, they often wear loose
            robes and avoid rings and jewelry.
          </p>
          <p>
            While in animal form, the shapechanger enjoys all the
            benefits and drawbacks implicit to that animal form.
            For example, a shark can "breathe" water, but is nearly
            helpless on land. Other benefits such as attack forms,
            AC changes, etc. are listed in the below stat blocks
            for convenience.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a stat block lists an HP bonus, your maximum and current
            HP are increased by that amount while you are in the
            form. If you leave the form, they both reduce by that
            amount, with the exception that you are not reduced below
            1 current or maximum HP by this change. However, the
            damage is "remembered" -- when you shift back into an animal
            form you still have that amount of damage. This damage
            must be healed first by any healing effect before you can
            be raised above 1 HP.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a stat block lists an attack form, it will list first
            an attack bonus and then the damage. The bonus is on top
            of your BAB and other bonuses.
          </p>
          <p>
            At 1st level, the shapechanger may choose an animal form
            they have already bonded with from the below list.
          </p>
          <p>
            More animal shapes can be added with referee permission.

          </p>
          <p>
            Proficiency with some items is implied rather than explicitly stated —
            a character knows how to tie their own shoes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Proficiency will be explicitly stated for the use of weapons, armors,

          <p>
            When an item is out of notches, it is destroyed or broken.
          </p>
          <p>
            A weapon gets −1 penalty to attack for each notch missing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Armor gets a −1 penalty to AC for each notch missing.
            A damaged magic device has a 5% chance of mishap for each notch
            missing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notches are usually lost from sundering, but the DM may rule that
            certain effects like fireballs can damage weapons too if the user
            fails a save.

            Ranged weapons and thrown weapons have a range increment.

          <p>
            For every full range-increment you suffer a –2 penalty to the attack.
            For example, if your weapon has a range increment of 15' and you attack
            from 35' away you suffer a –4.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ranged weapons can attack up to 10 range increments away
          </p>
          <p>
            Thrown Weapons can attack up to 5 range increments away

          <p>
            Wands have notches of durability, just as weapons do, also breaking
            and being destroyed when the 3rd notch of durability is gone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike weapons, wands lose a notch of durability when a natural 1
            is rolled for their attack roll.  If the wand does not have an
            attack rule (like the wand of healing), roll a d20 when you use
            it. On a 1, the wand loses a notch of durability. On a 20, the
            effect of the wand is doubled.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, wands may have special abilities that can be used.
            These special abilities may have a higher change of damaging a
            notch of durability or automatically losing a notch of durability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wands cannot be repaired by any means.

            <p>
              Drakes are degenerate dragons that have diminished in several qualities
              compared to their true dragon cousins. They are unable to breath fire,
              are less intelligent and attain a maximum size similar to that of a
              destrier. However, they mature much more quickly than true dragons,
              reaching adulthood at six years. Drakes are biologically immortal, but
              their violent nature means most drakes rarely make it past ten years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Drakes are wild creatures, but can be tamed and trained for riding or
              fighting. Training a drake for riding takes approximately six months.
              Drakes do not reproduce succesfully in captivity. If somehow forced
              (perhaps by enchantment), the offspring are born sickly and die in
              infancy. Captured juvenile drakes almost always grow ill and die.
            </p>
            <p>
              Drakes are normally solitary creatures. They reproduce by force and
              the female will lay its eggs in isolated sections of sand or gravel.
              5d6 drakes are laid at a time by the female. Upon hatching, the drakes
              fight to the death until only 4 remain. The survivors form an
              intensely loyal family unit that will remain together until adulthood,
              at which point they split ways, normally never to see each other again.
            </p>
            <p>
              An adult drake must eat an average of 30 pounds of meat per day to
              sustain itself. Drakes are not particulary picky eaters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Drakes are too foul tempered to wear barding. Besides, their scales
              are already as hard as plate armor.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following statistics are for an average male adult drake.

        <h1 id="hirelings">Hirelings</h1>
        <p>
          If a player wants to hire an NPC to work for them or to
          perform a specific task, see these rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Availability and price of a hireling depends upon locale.
        </p>
        <p>
          
        </p>
        <h2 id="loyalty">Loyalty</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes the loyalty of a hireling or companion
          will be tested, such as when facing a fire-breathing
          dragon or when faced with a large treasure. A loyalty
          test is rolled by rolling 2d6 + the character's current
          loyalty score.
        </p>
        <p>
          A roll of 7 or higher indicates that the character
          remains loyal, while a result below that indicates
          betrayal or shirking of duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          A failed loyalty test can manifest in different ways
          based on circumstance:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
                  A failed loyalty test in combat can indicate fleeing
                  or abandonment.</li>
          <li>        A failed loyalty test when faced with treasure
                  indicates stealing it.</li>
          <li>        Etc.
                  </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Companion descriptions list example circumstances
          that dictate need to test loyalty, but the referee
          can decide that certain circumstances dictate a
          check not listed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The loyalty of a companion or hireling starts at 0.
          This number increases due to positive interactions
          and decreases due to negative ones. In general, every
          doubling of pay increases starting loyalty of a
          hireling by 1.  Death of a non-combatant hireling
          decreases the base loyalty of all hirelings by 2
          (stacking) until the memory fades.
        </p>
        <p>
          Positive or negative reputation also changes the
          base loyalty of new hirelings and companions.
        </p>
        <p>
          When multiple hirelings of a single type are hired
          (such as mercenaries), the referee may assume all
          of their loyalty scores are the same.

        <h2 id="initiative-and-the-flow-of-combat">Initiative and the Flow of Combat</h2>
        <p>
          At the beginning of combat, each side rolls a d20.
          The side of the high roller gets to go first.
          Each turn after that alternates between the two sides.
        </p>
        <p>
          All characters on a side can take their turns and
          actions at the same time on their side's turn,
          or process them one at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beginning or end of a turn for a character
          is synonymous with the beginning or end of a
          turn for that character's side.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the d20 roll is a tie, it is a simultaneous turn.
          First one of the players goes, then one of the monsters
          goes, then one of the players goes, etc. The players can
          choose who they want to go, but they must choose within
          10 seconds or lose their chance to go.
        </p>
        <h3 id="surprise">Surprise</h3>
        <p>
          If one side has achieved surprise over the other,
          they get a free round before initiative is rolled.
          During this round, the members of their side can only
          take a single standard action each. The side that has
          been surprised is considered flat-footed.
        </p>
        <h2 id="actions-in-combat">Actions in Combat</h2>
        <p>
          During each round, you may take a move-action,
          standard-action, swift-action and reaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          A standard-action and a move-action may be
          combined together to take a full-action.
        </p>
        <p>
          A standard-action can be used to take a
          move-action.
        </p>
        <p>
          A standard-action can be readied to be performed
          contingent on some other visible action or effect.
          Readying an action this way does not require your
          reaction. The trigger must be perceivable by the
          character from an in-game perspective. For example,
          you can ready an action for when someone attacks
          any ally or draws their weapon, but not contingent
          on the start of someone's turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Swift-actions must happen during your turn. Any
          action that requires a swift-action will specify
          when it may be used. No other action type may be
          substituted for a swift-action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reactions can be taken during your turn or during
          anothers turn. Once you have taken a reaction you
          cannot take one until the beginning of your next turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          A free action does not require the use of any
          action (it is free). However, some free actions
          may be limited in how many times they can be repeated.
        </p>
        <h2 id="attack-roll">Attack Roll</h2>
        <p>
          When you attack a creature, you must roll an attack roll to determine
          whether or not you harm them. An attack roll is a d20 + your attack bonus.
          If you equal or exceed their AC with this roll, you have hit them and can roll damage.
        </p>
        <h3 id="calculating-attack-bonus">Calculating Attack Bonus</h3>
        <p>
          Normally, your attack bonus is your Base Attack Bonus
          (BAB) from your class, plus any circumstantial modifiers.
          Some items, class features or other effects might also
          grant you a bonus to your attacks.
        </p>
        <h2 id="critical-hit">Critical Hit</h2>
        <p>
          If you roll a natural 20 (or another natural number
          in your weapon's critical hit range), you have threatened
          a critical hit. Immediately make another attack roll with
          the same bonus. If that attack roll hits, then you have
          confirmed the critical hit. By default, weapons have a x2
          critical hit multiplier. This means you roll your damage
          and add your bonuses twice. For example, if you deal 1d6+3
          damage on a normal hit, a critical hit will deal
          1d6+3 + 1d6+3 = 2d6+6 damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some weapons have x3 or even x4 critical hit multipliers.
          In those cases, roll your damage and add your bonuses
          that many times instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spells with attack rolls can critically hit. They threaten
          on a natural 20 and have a x2 multiplier. If the spell does
          not deal damage, then critical hits have no extra effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some weapons specify a special effect upon a critical hit.
          Look to those weapons for the description.
        </p>
        <p>
          
        </p>
        <h2 id="attack-of-opportunity">Attack of Opportunity</h2>
        <p>
          An attack of opportunity is a reaction that is performed
          in response to some activity that lowers the opponent's
          guard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some actions specify they provoke an attack of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, a character moving away from you or moving
          within your reach provokes an attack of opportunity from
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a character has reach and you attempt to move beyond
          the edge of their reach towards them, you also provoke
          an attack of opportunity, even if you are moving into
          their deadzone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ranged Attacks provoke an attack of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most spells provoke attacks of opportunity. Melee attack
          spells, touch spells cast on allies, or spells originating
          from the caster with a length or radius of 15 ft or less
          do not provoke attacks of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drinking a potion or getting something out of your pack
          provokes an attack of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standing up from prone provokes an attack of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a character provokes an attack of opportunity from you,
          you may make an immediate, melee standard attack against
          them. You must be wielding a melee weapon in order to make
          this attack. If your unarmed strikes deal lethal damage,
          you are considered to be wielding a melee weapon for this
          purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you can somehow make more than one attack of opportunity
          each round, you can only make one for each opportunity. In
          this case, movement through your threatened spaces is only
          considered a single opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a creature provokes an attack of opportunity from more
          than one creature, only two creatures may actually make
          an attack of opportunity.

          You can spend movement before or after actions, given that
          something has granted you movement this turn such as the walk
          action. For example, you can take the walk action (to be able
          to move your speed this round), move 10 feet, make a standard
          action attack against a goblin, kill it, and then move 20 more feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can attempt to move through other creatures by making an
          <a href="#overrun">overrun</a> attempt.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may overrun during the course of a charge.

        <h2 id="firing-into-a-crowd">Firing into a crowd</h2>
        <p>
          Ranged attackers are obligated to target randomly between potential
          enemy targets who are near one another
        </p>
        <p>
          You can ignore this penalty by suffering a −4 penalty to your attack
          roll(s).
        </p>
        <h2 id="cover">Cover</h2>
        <p>
          A target behind cover receives a bonus to AC from attacks on the other
          side of cover, dependent on the extend of the cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          A creature can use a move action to &quot;take cover&quot;. This doubles
          the benefit of the cover until they leave it, either because they move or
          they take an action that requires leaving the cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          A creature behind total cover cannot be directly targeted or attacked.

        <h2 id="reach">Reach</h2>
        <p>
          Reach is how far away you can attack.
          By default, weapons and creatures have 5' of reach, thus they can only attack creatures adjacent to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some weapons, such as the spear, have 10' of reach. This means they can attack creatures up to 10' away, or within 2 spaces.
          However, the spear also has a 5' deadzone, meaning it can't attack creatures 5' away or closer. Thus a creature with a spear
          can only attack someone 5-10' away.
        </p>
        <h2 id="high-ground">High Ground</h2>
        <p>
          Attacks from the high ground receive a +1 bonus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference in height needs to be at least 2 feet
          for melee attacks and 6 feet for ranged attacks.
        </p>
        <h2 id="concealment">Concealment</h2>
        <p>
          Some effects (such as fog, blindness, invisbility or darkness) grant
          some degree of concealment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concealment is rated at either 20% or 50%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever an attack is made against a target with concealment, first
          roll the concealment percentage to see if it misses due to concealment.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it does not, then roll the attack roll as normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some circumstances, the DM may rule your attack will still need to
          be rolled, just not against who you intended. For example, firing at a
          figure you can barely see when he has a crowd behind him.
        </p>
        <h2 id="mounted-combat">Mounted Combat</h2>
        <p>
          In battle, mounts move faster than when out of combat. A warhorse
          has a speed of 60 feet when in combat.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are riding a mount, you use your actions to move the mount,
          but use the mount's speed. Your mount is not allowed to take actions
          while ridden.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you want to charge while riding a destrier, you take
          a full-round action. The destrier moves 120 feet, at the end of which
          you can make a reckless attack, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mounts can overrun as part of their movement. They use your attack
          bonus, but their size. A mount's description will list if this inflicts
          any trample damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          While you are mounted, you can only use 1-handed weapons, not light
          weapons or two-handed weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          While you are mounted and your opponent is not, you are considered
          to have the high ground.

                You may make a single overrun attempt during your turn.

              <p>
                You can only overrun creatures at most one size
                category larger than you.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you allow them to move aside and they choose to move
                aside, then you move through their space with no consequence
                (not even an attack of opportunity from the movement) and
                this does not count as your overrun attempt.
              </p>
              <p>
                Otherwise, you and your opponent make opposed attack rolls.
              </p>
              <p>
                A creature larger than medium gets +4 for every size category
                larger and creatures smaller than medium get a −4 penalty for
                each category smaller.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you win the opposed check, then you knock your opponent
                prone and keep moving through them, without provoking attacks
                of opportunity.
              </p>
              <p>
                You must move at least 10' straight through them and are
                not allowed to double back.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you or your mount deal trample damage, the damage is
                automatically inflicted if you win.
              </p>
              <p>
                Otherwise, you are knocked prone instead and your movement
                immediately ends.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some creatures (like horses) are not knocked prone on a failed
                attempt and can attempt multiple overruns in a round. If they
                fail, their movement instead ceases.

              <p>
                A grapple check is rolled by making an unarmed

                Creatures larger than medium get +4 for each

              <p>
                If you win this check, you and your opponent are

              <p>
                You can't force a creature two sizes larger than
                you to grapple and such a creature can automatically
                escape such a grapple if he finds himself in one.
              </p>
              <p>
                You and your opponent are both considered to be

              <p>
                Any ranged attacks into the grapple are equally

              </p>
              <p>
                If the creatures are of different size, the ratio

                Multiple creatures can be in a grapple.

                Once a grapple is initiated, it is a standard action
                to join the grapple, but you do not need to beat any
                grapple check to join.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you need to roll an opposed check while in the
                grapple, pick an enemy grappler at random to oppose
                you.

                                at −4 and if you succeed you are still grappled, just not

              <p>
                Grab is a special attack that monsters have, such as those
                with pincers. A creature capable of a grab can only
                grab creatures one size smaller than it or smaller.
              </p>
              <p>
                It works in many ways like grapple. All opposed checks are
                calculated the same, except that the monster is treated as
                one size smaller for the purpose of calculating bonuses.

                                (and even so at a −4 penalty).</li>

                <li>                You can't draw weapons or items without winning an opposed

                <li>                Allies can make a grapple check against the monster to
                                free you. (They don't need to join a grapple or anything.)</li>
                <li>                If you are held in the monster's mouth, you automatically
                                fail saving throws against the monster's breath weapon.
                                </li>

                                Can't use the limb or appendage except against you.</li>
                <li>                Can fling you away as an attack.  You are flung 10' per
                                size category of the monster above medium (10 for large,
                                20 for huge, etc.), minimum 10'.
                                You suffer 1d6 damage for every 10' you are flung
                                (doubled if you hit a rigid object like a wall).</li>
                <li>                Can fling you at a creature as an attack. This works the
                                same as above, except the monster needs to make an attack
                                roll against the target. If they hit, both you and the
                                target take the same amount of damage. If they miss, you
                                still take the flinging damage.</li>
                <li>                Can deal damage with the grabbing limb or appendage by
                                winning an opposed grapple check. Some monsters deal bonus
                                damage by doing this.</li>

            A creature that is ablaze is on fire.

            Unless otherwise specified, they suffer 1d6 fire
            damage at the beginning of their turn unless they
            succeed at a DC 15 reflex save to put the fire out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rolling on the ground grants a new save against the
            fire at +4.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dousing the flame immediately puts the fire out.

          <h2 id="blind">Blind</h2>
          <p>
            A blinded creature suffers −4 AC.

          <p>
            Any attack they made is against 50% concealment.

          <h2 id="confused">Confused</h2>
          <p>
            A confused character’s actions are determined by rolling
            d% at the beginning of his turn (see table below).
          </p>
          <p>
            A confused character who can’t carry out the indicated
            action does nothing but babble incoherently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking
            a confused character.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any confused character who is attacked automatically attacks
            its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still
            confused when its turn comes.
          </p>
          <p>
            A confused character does not make attacks of opportunity
            against any creature that it is not already devoted to
            attacking (either because of its most recent action or
            because it has just been attacked).

            If the entanglement would affect their attacks, they get
            −2 to their attacks.
            For example, a tanglefoot bag entangles the feet so it
            has no effect on attacks, but being tangled up in a
            net would.
