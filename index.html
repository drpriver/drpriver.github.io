        <h1 id="leveling-up">Leveling Up</h1>
        <p>
          A character who has earned sufficient XP may level up by spending
          some amount of downtime and resources to train.
        </p>
        <p>
          A character can only level up during downtime periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gaining multiple levels is permitted.
        </p>
        <h2 id="how-to-level-up">How to Level Up</h2>
        <p>
          Leveling up is mostly self-explanatory: Update your values according
          to your class's table and make any choices offered to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hit points are rolled using the Sticky-Up method.
        </p>
        <h3 id="sticky-up-hp-rolling">Sticky-Up HP Rolling</h3>
        <p>
          When you gain a new level, roll the dice indicated in your class's HP
          column. If you rolled equal to or lower than your previous HP total,
          your HP increases by 1. Otherwise, your HP becomes the number you
          rolled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, your HP is rerolled at each level, but can only go up (sticky-up).

        <h2 id="jumping">Jumping</h2>
        <p>
          To determine how far you can jump horizontally, roll 2d10 + your strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine how far you can jump vertically, roll d10 + your strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, the target number is typically set by what you are
          trying to jump across or to and you need to roll that number.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can jump a horizontal distance up to your speed and a vertical
          distance up to triple your height, rounded up to the nearest 5' increment.
        </p>
        <p>
          For every size category smaller than medium, you get -4 to your
          jump checks. For every size category larger than medium, add +4
          to your jump checks.
        </p>
        <p>
          For every 5' slower than 30', you get -2 to jump. For every 5'
          faster than 30', you get +2 to jump.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jumping in combat is normally a part of your movement for the turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          If something allows to jump as a specific action, then the amount
          of distance you jump is extra movement granted by that action.
        </p>
        <p>
          In combat, you cannot jump farther than your remaining movement
          for the round.
        </p>
        <h2 id="double-jeopardy">Double Jeopardy</h2>
        <p>
          In almost all cases, the same action cannot be attempted twice.
          For example, if a character fails to pick a lock, the party cannot
          retry that lock. They will need to do something substantively
          different, usually escalating the situation.
        </p>
        <h2 id="natural-healing">Natural Healing</h2>
        <p>
          Characters heal their level in hit points each night.
          If they rest all day, they heal twice as much.
        </p>
        <h2 id="food-and-water">Food and Water</h2>
        <p>
          After 3 days, a character must make a fortitude save
          (DC 10 + 1 for each day without food beyond the 3 days) each day
          or suffer 1d6 unhealable damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each day of food heals 1d6 of this damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          After 1 day without water, a character must make a fortitude save
          (DC 10 + 5 for each day without water) each day
          or suffer 3d6 unhealable damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each day of water heals 1d6 of this damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          If characters go on half-rations,
          they suffer -2 to all d20 rolls
          but eat half as many rations each day
          and stave off the starvation damage.
        </p>
        <h2 id="heat-and-humidity">Heat and Humidity</h2>
        <p>
          A character in excessive clothing or wearing armor
          suffers 1d6 unhealable heat exhaustion damage each hour
          in hot and humid climates.
        </p>
        <p>
          An hour in cool shade with water heals 1d6 of this damage.
        </p>
        <h2 id="cold-and-freezing">Cold and Freezing</h2>
        <p>
          A characer in inadequate clothing suffers 1d6 unhealable
          freezing damage each hour in cold or arctic climates.
        </p>
        <p>
          An hour in shelter with fire heals 1d6 of this damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          In even extremer cold, the rate of damage is increased.
        </p>
        <h2 id="suffocation">Suffocation</h2>
        <p>
          A character without air suffers 1d6 suffocation damage

          <p>
            Due to your weak tie to Venrik, you occasionally are seized with divine
            inspiration. When not stressed due to battle or other extenuating
            circumstances, choose 5 of the maneuvers you know. Those maneuvers are
            prepared for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Management of maneuvers is simulated by use of playing cards. Each
            card represents one of the maneuvers you have prepared. At the beginning
            of your first turn of the encounter draw three (3) cards at random from
            the 5 maneuvers you've prepared. At the beginning of your following turns,
            draw an additional card from the maneuvers you haven't drawn yet. When you
            use a maneuver, place the card in your discard pile. If you have no more
            maneuvers you can draw, discard your current hand of cards and shuffle it
            into your discard pile. That pile then becomes the new pool you can draw
            from. Immediately draw two cards.
          </p>
          <p>
            At higher levels you will know more maneuvers than you can prepare. To
            change your prepared maneuvers, you can spend 10 minutes meditating and
            praying to Venrik.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you gain a level in this class, you can choose a maneuver you know
            and replace it with a different maneuver of the same level.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are 3 kinds of maneuvers: Strikes, Counters and Boosts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise specified, strikes are a standard action to use and
            involve you making a melee standard attack. Counters are always a reaction
            action. Unless otherwise specified, boosts are swift actions.

          <p>
            As a disiciple of the enlightened, you have gained the ability to bring
            order to the chaotic elements of your soul. By meditating for 10 minutes,
            you can remove the chaos from your system.
          </p>
          <p>
            This state of balance lasts until it is disrupted. Roll a d6 at the beginning
            of each turn in a stressful situation like combat. If you roll a 4, 5, or 6,
            your balance is disrupted. By disrupting it, you achieve a temporary state of
            enlightenment, walking in the footsteps of those that came before you — Gentle
            Breeze and Kruglauk.
          </p>
          <p>
            While in this state of enlightenment, you gain the following benefits:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You partially ignore the tragedy of flesh — You take half damage from all sources.</li>
            <li>Your mind is shielded from the influence of others — You automatically succeed on any saving throws against fear, rage, or other mental effects such as mind control.</li>
            <li>Your blows strike swift and true — You can make an unarmed melee standard attack as a free action each round.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These benefits last until your are unconscious, the battle is over or 10 minutes pass,
            whichever comes soonest.
          </p>
          <h3 id="unarmed-and-unarmored">Unarmed and Unarmored</h3>
          <p>
            While wearing no armor, your base AC is higher than 10. The value is given in your
            class table. You are deftly able to dodge blows due to your ability to perceive
            reality in a different way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, while wearing no armor your speed is increased by 10.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are deadly with the fist. Your unarmed strikes deal extra damage and can
            be dual-wielded.
          </p>
          <p>
            You do not receive a penalty when attempting an unarmed disarm attempt.
          </p>
          <p>
            You do not need to be unarmed to make unarmed attacks.

                            as there is no &quot;where&quot;. You can appear at any &quot;location&quot;
                            you can see instantaneously as a free action up to &quot;600 feet away&quot;.

            The Dragon Knights of Bahamut train vigorously and are rewarded
            with special powers. Outside of battle, choose to ready a number
            of maneuvers as given by your class table. You cannot ready the
            same maneuver more than once. When a battle starts, you have
            immediate access to the maneuvers you have readied. Once you have
            used one of the maneuvers you have readied, you cannot use it again
            until you are recentered.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can recenter by taking a refocus action. This action grants you
            a standard melee attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            At higher levels you will know more maneuvers than you can prepare.
            To change your prepared maneuvers, you can spend 10 minutes meditating.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you gain a level in this class, you can choose a maneuver you
            know and replace it with a different maneuver of the same level.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are 3 kinds of maneuvers: Strikes, Counters and Boosts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise specified, strikes are a standard action to use
            and involve you making a melee standard attack. Counters are always
            a reaction action. Unless otherwise specified, boosts are swift
            actions.

            If tending to wounds, the Master of the Five Humors adds his level to
            the amount healed. If treating a creature that is diseased or poisoned,
            the creature can add the level of the Master of the Five Humors to his

            The Master of the Five Humors understand the needed balance of the
            five essential humors: Blood, Black Bile, Yellow Bile, Phlegm and
            Occult Bile. When these humors are out of balance, illness and other
            tragedy ensue. However, he also knows how to manipulate these humors
            for temporary positive effects. It is dangerous to manipulate a person's
            humors too frequently. They can do so to a single creature once per
            hour and each concoction lasts for 1 minute.
          </p>
          <p>
            The master can create his concoctions by spending an hour. Each
            concoction takes a slot. He can create as many of each as he wants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Injecting a concoction into a creature is a standard action. If the
            creature is unwilling, they are allowed a DC 15 reflex save to avoid.
            Only the master can inject these concoctions, everyone else is too dumb.
            Injection is a melee move.

            Your animal knows the following tricks (assuming it is physically
            capable of them):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Attack</li>
            <li>Come</li>

            <li>Work</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Your animal performs these tricks by verbal or nonverbal communication.
            If you wish them to perform these tricks by a different word (such as
            using the elvish word for attack), note this, but each trick must have
            a single corresponding verbal
          </p>
          <p>
            Your animal is a selfless and loyal companion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to your bond and excellent training, your companion receives
            the following bonuses:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A bonus to attack equal to your level</li>
            <li>A bonus to AC equal to your level</li>
            <li>A bonus to saving throws equal to your level</li>
            <li>A bonus number of hit dice equal to your level</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Your animal companion uses a stat block that is not typical of other
            creatures of its kind. They already include the first level bonuses.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your companion perishes, you must raise a new one in order to replace
            them. Training a new companion takes at least 3 months.

            Rangers can make charisma checks to influence animals. They communicate
            via a combination of body gestures, sounds and smells. The animal
            communicates back via emotion and feeling.

          </ul>
          <h3 id="animal-forms">Animal Forms</h3>
          <p>
            Shapechangers have the unique ability to transform into
            an animal that they have established a spirit bond with.
            The number of bonds they can establish is limited by
            their level, as given in the class table above.
          </p>
          <p>
            To establish a spirit bond with an animal, the shapechanger
            must seek out and befriend the animal and either make a
            deal with it or earn its trust. The shapechanger and the
            animal then link their spirits together and the shapechanger
            is then able to turn into that specific animal.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the shapechanger dies, all the animals it has bonded
            with die as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shapechanger may change shape whenever they want and
            however many times they want. Changing shape is an
            instinctual action. In combat, it is a move action.
            The shapechanger can switch between animal forms or back
            to their normal form.  The shapechanger remains in the
            animal form until they consciously change shape again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Items worn or carried by the shapechanger do not change
            shape with them. For this reason, they often wear loose
            robes and avoid rings and jewelry.
          </p>
          <p>
            While in animal form, the shapechanger enjoys all the
            benefits and drawbacks implicit to that animal form.
            For example, a shark can "breathe" water, but is nearly
            helpless on land. Other benefits such as attack forms,
            AC changes, etc. are listed in the below stat blocks
            for convenience.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a stat block lists an HP bonus, your maximum and current
            HP are increased by that amount while you are in the
            form. If you leave the form, they both reduce by that
            amount, with the exception that you are not reduced below
            1 current or maximum HP by this change. However, the
            damage is "remembered" -- when you shift back into an animal
            form you still have that amount of damage. This damage
            must be healed first by any healing effect before you can
            be raised above 1 HP.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a stat block lists an attack form, it will list first
            an attack bonus and then the damage. The bonus is on top
            of your BAB and other bonuses.
          </p>
          <p>
            At 1st level, the shapechanger may choose an animal form
            they have already bonded with from the below list.
          </p>
          <p>
            More animal shapes can be added with referee permission.

            A character can carry 10 + strength slots of items without being encumbered.
          </p>
          <p>
            They receive a -1 penalty to attack and AC for each slot beyond that they
            are carrying.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two day's worth of food is 1 slot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weapons are 1 slot, except for two-handed weapons which are 2 slots.
          </p>
          <h2 id="durability">Durability</h2>
          <p>
            Items have 3 &quot;notches&quot; of durability.
          </p>
          <p>
            When an item is out of notches, it is destroyed or broken.
          </p>
          <p>
            A weapon gets -1 penalty to attack for each notch missing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Armor gets a -1 penalty to AC for each notch missing.
            A damaged magic device has a 5% chance of mishap for each notch
            missing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notches are usually lost from sundering, but the DM may rule that
            certain effects like fireballs can damage weapons too if the user
            fails a save.

          <h2 id="range-increment">Range Increment</h2>
          <p>
            Ranged weapons and thrown weapons have a range increment.
          </p>
          <p>
            For every full range-increment you suffer a –2 penalty to the attack.
            For example, if your weapon has a range increment of 15' and you attack
            from 35' away you suffer a –4.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ranged weapons can attack up to 10 range increments away
          </p>
          <p>
            Thrown Weapons can attack up to 5 range increments away

            A magic device is a scroll, wand or staff.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are not proficient in the use of a magic device,
            you need to make a charisma check, with the difficulty
            depending on the device.
          </p>
          <p>
            A failure to activate the item is usually benign,
            unless a natural 1 is rolled. In which case, roll
            on the magical mishaps table.

        <h2 id="initiative-and-the-flow-of-combat">Initiative and the Flow of Combat</h2>
        <p>
          At the beginning of combat, each side rolls a d20.
          The side of the high roller gets to go first.
          Each turn after that alternates between the two sides.
        </p>
        <p>
          All characters on a side can take their turns and
          actions at the same time on their side's turn,
          or process them one at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beginning or end of a turn for a character
          is synonymous with the beginning or end of a
          turn for that character's side.
        </p>
        <p>
          If one side has achieved surprise over the other,
          they get a free round before initiative is rolled.
          During this round, the members of their side can only
          take a single standard action each. The side that has
          been surprised is considered flat-footed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the d20 roll is a tie, it is a simultaneous turn.
          First one of the players goes, then one of the monsters
          goes, then one of the players goes, etc. The players can
          choose who they want to go, but they must choose within
          10 seconds or lose their chance to go.
        </p>
        <h2 id="actions-in-combat">Actions in Combat</h2>
        <p>
          During each round, you may take a move-action,
          standard-action, swift-action and reaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          A standard-action and a move-action may be
          combined together to take a full-action.
        </p>
        <p>
          A standard-action can be used to take a
          move-action.
        </p>
        <p>
          A standard-action can be readied to be performed
          contingent on some other visible action or effect.
          Readying an action this way does not require your
          reaction. The trigger must be perceivable by the
          character from an in-game perspective. For example,
          you can ready an action for when someone attacks
          any ally or draws their weapon, but not contingent
          on the start of someone's turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Swift-actions must happen during your turn. Any
          action that requires a swift-action will specify
          when it may be used. No other action type may be
          substituted for a swift-action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reactions can be taken during your turn or during
          anothers turn. Once you have taken a reaction you
          cannot take one until the beginning of your next turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          A free action does not require the use of any
          action (it is free). However, some free actions
          may be limited in how many times they can be repeated.
        </p>
        <h2 id="calculating-attack-bonus">Calculating Attack Bonus</h2>
        <p>
          Normally, your attack bonus is your Base Attack Bonus
          (BAB) from your class, plus any circumstantial modifiers.
          Some items, class features or other effects might also
          grant you a bonus to your attacks.
        </p>
        <h2 id="critical-hits">Critical Hits</h2>
        <p>
          If you roll a natural 20 (or another natural number
          in your weapon's critical hit range), you have threatened
          a critical hit. Immediately make another attack roll with
          the same bonus. If that attack roll hits, then you have
          confirmed the critical hit. By default, weapons have a x2
          critical hit multiplier. This means you roll your damage
          and add your bonuses twice. For example, if you deal 1d6+3
          damage on a normal hit, a critical hit will deal
          1d6+3 + 1d6+3 = 2d6+6 damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some weapons have x3 or even x4 critical hit multipliers.
          In those cases, roll your damage and add your bonuses
          that many times instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spells with attack rolls can critically hit. They threaten
          on a natural 20 and have a x2 multiplier. If the spell does
          not deal damage, then critical hits have no extra effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some weapons specify a special effect upon a critical hit.
          Look to those weapons for the description.
        </p>
        <p>
          
        </p>
        <h2 id="attack-of-opportunity">Attack of Opportunity</h2>
        <p>
          An attack of opportunity is a reaction that is performed
          in response to some activity that lowers the opponent's
          guard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some actions specify they provoke an attack of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, a character moving away from you or moving
          within your reach provokes an attack of opportunity from
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a character has reach and you attempt to move beyond
          the edge of their reach towards them, you also provoke
          an attack of opportunity, even if you are moving into
          their deadzone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ranged Attacks provoke an attack of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most spells provoke attacks of opportunity. Melee attack
          spells, touch spells cast on allies, or spells originating
          from the caster with a length or radius of 15 ft or less
          do not provoke attacks of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drinking a potion or getting something out of your pack
          provokes an attack of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standing up from prone provokes an attack of opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a character provokes an attack of opportunity from you,
          you may make an immediate, melee standard attack against
          them. You must be wielding a melee weapon in order to make
          this attack. If your unarmed strikes deal lethal damage,
          you are considered to be wielding a melee weapon for this
          purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you can somehow make more than one attack of opportunity
          each round, you can only make one for each opportunity. In
          this case, movement through your threatened spaces is only
          considered a single opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a creature provokes an attack of opportunity from more
          than one creature, only two creatures may actually make
          an attack of opportunity.

                Once a grapple is initiated, it is an attack to join
                the grapple, but you do not need to beat any grapple
                check to join.

                <li>                Escape the grapple. You must win an opposed grapple check
                                (you may use Escape) against the enemy grappler in the 
                                grapple. He gets +2 to this check for every ally he has
                                in the grapple.</li>
                <li>                Pin an opponent. You must win an opposed grapple check

                <li>                Break a pin on self or other. You must win an opposed

                                to this check for every ally he has in the grapple.</li>
                <li>                Attack with another's light weapon. You must win an

                                can make a normal attack against them without penalty with
                                that weapon.</li>

                                is the same as trying to escape the grapple, but you are 
                                at -4 and if you succeed you are still grappled, just not
                                pinned.</li>
                <li>                You suffer a -2 penalty to AC in addition to the

                                must be directed against who you are pinning. You get +4

                <li>                You may also attempt to disarm them of well-secured items. 
                                They get +4 to resist this disarm.</li>
                <li>                You can release them from the pin as a free action.

              <p>
                Grab is a special attack that monsters have, such as those
                with pincers.
              </p>
              <p>
                It works in many ways like grapple. All opposed checks are
                calculated the same, except that the monster is treated as
                one size smaller for this purpose.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are grabbed:

                <li>
                                You don't threaten any spaces with attacks of opportunity.</li>
                <li>                You are considered flat-footed against anyone but the monster.</li>
                <li>                You can't move.</li>
                <li>                If the monster moves, you move with him.</li>
                <li>                You can't attack with weapons larger than light 
                                (and even so at a -4 penalty).</li>
                <li>                You can't cast most spells (exception: instant teleports)</li>
                <li>                You can't attack anyone but the monster.</li>
                <li>                You can't draw weapons or items without winning an opposed
                                grapple check.</li>
                <li>                You can't dual-wield.</li>
                <li>                You can make a grapple or Escape check to escape.</li>
                <li>                Allies can make a grapple check against the monster to
                                free you. (They don't need to join a grapple or anything.)</li>
                <li>                If you are held in the monster's mouth, you automatically
                                fail saving throws against the monster's breath weapon.
                                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The monster:

                <li>
                                Can't use the limb or appendage except against you.</li>
                <li>                Can fling you away as an attack.  You are flung 10' per
                                size category of the monster above medium (10 for large,
                                20 for huge, etc.), minimum 10'.
                                You suffer 1d6 damage for every 10' you are flung 
                                (doubled if you hit a rigid object like a wall).</li>
                <li>                Can fling you at a creature as an attack. This works the
                                same as above, except the monster needs to make an attack 
                                roll against the target. If they hit, both you and the
                                target take the same amount of damage. If they miss, you
                                still take the flinging damage.</li>
                <li>                Can deal damage with the grabbing limb or appendage by
                                winning an opposed grapple check. Some monsters deal bonus
                                damage by doing this.</li>
                <li>                Can use the held creature as a shield (+2 shield bonus 
                                to AC). This requires a move action.</li>
                <li>                Otherwise suffers no consequences.

          action attack against a goblin, kill it, and then move 20 more feet.

          You can attempt to move through other creatures by making an

                this does not count as your overrun attempt.
              </p>
              <p>

                prone and keep moving through them, without provoking attacks
                of opportunity.
              </p>

                You must move at least 10' straight through them and are

              </p>
              <p>

              <p>
                Some creatures (like horses) are not knocked prone on a failed

        </p>
        <p>
          If you are riding a mount, you use your actions to move the mount,
          but use the mount's speed. Your mount is not allowed to take actions
          while ridden.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you want to charge while riding a destrier, you take
          a full-round action. The destrier moves 120 feet, at the end of which
          you can make a reckless attack, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mounts can overrun as part of their movement. They use your attack
          bonus, but their size. A mount's description will list if this inflicts
          any trample damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          While you are mounted, you can only use 1-handed weapons, not light
          weapons or two-handed weapons.
          While you are mounted and your opponent is not, you are considered
          to have the high ground.

            Unless otherwise specified, they suffer 1d6 fire

            Rolling on the ground grants a new save against the
            fire at +4.

            Dousing the flame immediately puts the fire out.

          <p>
            A confused character’s actions are determined by rolling
            d% at the beginning of his turn (see table below).
          </p>
          <p>
            A confused character who can’t carry out the indicated
            action does nothing but babble incoherently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking
            a confused character.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any confused character who is attacked automatically attacks
            its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still
            confused when its turn comes.
          </p>
          <p>
            A confused character does not make attacks of opportunity
            against any creature that it is not already devoted to
            attacking (either because of its most recent action or
            because it has just been attacked).

            If the entanglement would affect their attacks, they get
            -2 to their attacks.
            For example, a tanglefoot bag entangles the feet so it
            has no effect on attacks, but being tangled up in a
            net would.
