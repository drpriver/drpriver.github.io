<h3 id="maneuvers">Maneuvers</h3>
<p>Due to your weak tie to Venrik, you occasionally are seized with divine inspiration. When not stressed due to battle or other extenuating circumstances, choose 5 of the maneuvers you know. Those maneuvers are prepared for you.</p>
<p>Management of maneuvers is simulated by use of playing cards. Each card represents one of the maneuvers you have prepared. At the beginning of your first turn of the encounter draw three (3) cards at random from the 5 maneuvers you've prepared. At the beginning of your following turns, draw an additional card from the maneuvers you haven't drawn yet. When you use a maneuver, place the card in your discard pile. If you have no more maneuvers you can draw, discard your current hand of cards and shuffle it into your discard pile. That pile then becomes the new pool you can draw from. Immediately draw two cards.</p>
<p>At higher levels you will know more maneuvers than you can prepare. To change your prepared maneuvers, you can spend 10 minutes meditating and praying to Venrik.</p>
<p>When you gain a level in this class, you can choose a maneuver you know and replace it with a different maneuver of the same level.</p>
<p>There are 3 kinds of maneuvers: Strikes, Counters and Boosts.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, strikes are a standard action to use and involve you making a melee standard attack. Counters are always a reaction action. Unless otherwise specified, boosts are swift actions.</p>

<h3 id="class-details-2">Class Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Proficiency with the spear, quarterstaff, sling, greataxe and orcish shotput.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="enlightened-focus">Enlightened Focus</h3>
<p>As a disiciple of the enlightened, you have gained the ability to bring order to the chaotic elements of your soul. By meditating for 10 minutes, you can remove the chaos from your system.</p>
<p>This state of balance lasts until it is disrupted. Roll a d6 at the beginning of each turn in a stressful situation like combat. If you roll a 4, 5, or 6, your balance is disrupted. By disrupting it, you achieve a temporary state of enlightenment, walking in the footsteps of those that came before you — Gentle Breeze and Kruglauk.</p>
<p>While in this state of enlightenment, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You partially ignore the tragedy of flesh — You take half damage from all sources.</li>
<li>Your mind is shielded from the influence of others — You automatically succeed on any saving throws against fear, rage, or other mental effects such as mind control.</li>
<li>Your blows strike swift and true — You can make a melee standard attack as a free action each round.</li>
</ul>
<p>These benefits last until your are unconscious, the battle is over or 10 minutes pass, whichever comes soonest.</p>
<h3 id="unarmed-and-unarmored">Unarmed and Unarmored</h3>
<p>While wearing no armor, your base AC is higher than 10. The value is given in your class table. You are deftly able to dodge blows due to your ability to perceive reality in a different way.</p>
<p>Additionally, while wearing no armor your speed is increased by 10.</p>
<p>You are deadly with the fist. Your unarmed strikes deal extra damage. Additionally, if you take the rapid attack action and only attack with unarmed strikes, you ignore the normal penalties from the action.</p>
<p>You do not need to be unarmed to make unarmed attacks.</p>
<h3 id="disciple-discoveries">Disciple Discoveries</h3>
<p>As each Disciple of the enlightened makes their way in the world, they discover new fragments of enlightenment. Choose a discovery from the list below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Empty Body<ul><li>You have discovered how to very briefly not be somewhere and then immediately reappear. It is so brief that it requires great reflexes to achive, but is very useful when trying to avoid a dragon's breath. When you make a reflex saving throw to take half damage, you take no damage on a succesful saving throw and half damage on a failed saving throw.</li></ul></li>
<li>Abundant Step<ul><li> You have discovered that movement is an illusion, as all is one. This discovery is hard to wrap your mind around, but allows you to appear wherever you desire, as there is no &quot;where&quot;. You can appear at any &quot;location&quot; you can see instantaneously as a free action up to &quot;600 feet away&quot;. You cannot bring anything with you except the clothes on your back and what you hold in your hands. Once you have done this, you will need to meditate as even after you perform it you form pearls of doubt. You can't do this again until you complete your 10 minute meditation where you remove chaos from your system.</li> </ul></li>
<li>Purity of Body <ul> You have discovered that hunger and thirst are illusions. You no longer need to eat or drink and cannot be diseased or poisoned.</li></ul></li>
<li>The Thickness of Air <ul> You have discovered that air is as thick as we choose to perceive it to be. You can use this fact to slow and cushion your movements. You take no damage from being thrown or falling.</li></ul></li>
<li>Leap of the Clouds <ul> Your jump distance is no longer limited by your speed, height or size.</li></ul></li>
<li>Uncanny Awareness <ul> You have discovered the presence of a vestigial, ethereal third eye that we all have. You are never surprised or flat-footed.</li></ul></li>
<li>Deflection <ul> You can deflect arrows as a reaction, taking no damage from the one missile. As a full-round action, you can deflect all missiles that would strike you until the beginning of your next turn.</li></ul></li>
<li>The Laws of Momentum <ul> You can use an enemy's momentum against them. Whenever an enemy attacks you but misses, you make make a standard melee attack against them as a reaction.</li></ul></li>
<li>Tongue of the Sun and Moon <ul> You have discovered the proto-language of all humanoids. You can speak to any humanoids via it, although the concepts you can communicate are limited to basic ones.</li></ul></li>

<h3 id="maneuvers-1">Maneuvers</h3>
<p>The Dragon Knights of Bahamut train vigorously and are rewarded with special powers. Outside of battle, choose to ready a number of maneuvers as given by your class table. You cannot ready the same maneuver more than once. When a battle starts, you have immediate access to the maneuvers you have readied. Once you have used one of the maneuvers you have readied, you cannot use it again until you are recentered.</p>
<p>You can recenter by taking a refocus action. This action grants you a standard melee attack.</p>
<p>At higher levels you will know more maneuvers than you can prepare. To change your prepared maneuvers, you can spend 10 minutes meditating.</p>
<p>When you gain a level in this class, you can choose a maneuver you know and replace it with a different maneuver of the same level.</p>

<h3 id="concoctions">Concoctions</h3>
<p>The Master of the Five Humors understand the needed balance of the five essential humors: Blood, Black Bile, Yellow Bile, Phlegm and Occult Bile. When these humors are out of balance, illness and other tragedy ensue. However, he also knows how to manipulate these humors for temporary positive effects. It is dangerous to manipulate a person's humors too frequently. They can do so to a single creature once per hour and each concoction lasts for 1 minute.</p>
<p>The master can create his concoctions by spending an hour. Each concoction takes a slot. He can create as many of each as he wants.</p>
<p>Injecting a concoction into a creature is a standard action. If the creature is unwilling, they are allowed a DC 15 reflex save to avoid. Only the master can inject these concoctions, everyone else is too dumb. Injection is a melee move.</p>
<p>Choose concoctions from the list below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concoction of Valor — 5 Temp HP and +1 saves against fear</li>
<li>Concoction of Speed — +10 movement speed and +1 reflex saves</li>
<li>Concoction of Fire — Can belch a 3d6 15' cone of fire at a target once as a standard action. DC 15 reflex for half.</li>
<li>Concoction of Speed — -5 HP and can make a free standard attack once per round.</li>
<li>Concoction of Strength — +2 to melee attacks and +2 damage.</li>
<li>Concoction of Precision — +2 to ranged attacks and +2 damage.</li>
<li>Concoction of Insanity — Berserk— +4 attack and damage, 50% resistance to damage, attacks until there are no creature within sight, targets randomly (includes allies).</li>
<li>Concoction of Shrink — Shrinks to halfling size (melee attacks deal 50% damage and are small).</li>

<h3 id="animal-companion">Animal Companion</h3>
<p>You start play with an animal companion from the following list:</p>
<pre><code>* War Dog
* Hunting Dog
* Giant Crab
* Giant Snake
* Rodent of Unusual Size
* Hawk</code></pre>
<p>Your DM may expand or restrict this list due to the setting or campaign premise.</p>
<p>Your animal knows the following tricks (assuming it is physically capable of them):</p>
<pre><code>* Attack
* Come
* Defend
* Down
* Fetch
* Guard
* Heel
* Perform
* Seek
* Stay
* Track
* Work</code></pre>
<p>Your animal performs these tricks by verbal or nonverbal communication. If you wish them to perform these tricks by a different word (such as using the elvish word for attack), note this, but each trick must have a single corresponding verbal command.</p>
<p>Your animal is a selfless and loyal companion.</p>
<p>Due to your bond and excellent training, your companion receives the following bonuses:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bonus to attack equal to your level</li>
<li>A bonus to AC equal to your level</li>
<li>A bonus to saving throws equal to your level</li>
<li>A bonus number of hit dice equal to your level</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, your animal companion uses a stat block that is not typical of other creatures of its kind. See below for the stat blocks. They already include the first level bonuses.</p>
<p>If your companion perishes, you must raise a new one in order to replace them. Training a new companion takes at least 3 months. </p>

<h3 id="swords-and-bows-ii">Swords and Bows II</h3>
<p>Rangers can make an additional attack each round if dual-wielding or using a bow.</p>
<h3 id="ambusher">Ambusher</h3>

<h3 id="arcane-attack">Arcane Attack</h3>
<p>Periodically elves discover the ability to combine magic with war.</p>
<p>Each time you gain this feature, choose one of the special attacks below. You can use this attack once per encounter. You regain the use of them by trancing for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>The ability is activated as a swift action and affects the next attack made. If used with a melee attack, the effect does not discharge until you actually hit an enemy or the battle is over.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shocking Attack — Add 1d6/level lightning damage to an attack.</li>
<li>Translocating Attack — Choose one— You are teleported to where your attack lands. If it struck a creature, you appear next to them; OR A creature or object of medium size or smaller that you strike with this attack is teleported next to you. For example, if you make a called shot to an ogre's club, its club appears next to you.</li>
<li>True Strike — Add +10 to your attack roll and ignore less than total cover and concealment. This effect discharges even if you miss.</li>
<li>Acid Attack — Add 2d4 acid damage to your attack. The victim continues to take 2d4 acid damage each round for as many rounds as you have levels.</li>
<li>Force Blanket — A foe struck by this attack deals half damage with their next succesful attack as the force blanket absorbs much of the impact.</li>
<li>Hidden Attack — A creature or object of medium size or smaller that you strike with this attack becomes invisible for as many rounds as you have levels.</li>
<li>Twin Strike — Your weapon is in two places at once. You can attack two targets instead of one with this attack. This effect discharges even if you miss.</li>
